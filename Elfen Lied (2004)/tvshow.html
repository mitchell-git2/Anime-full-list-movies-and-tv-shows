However, they only encounter her in her innocent &quot;Nyu&quot; state. She is hit over the head by Bando. Bando then tells his partner to finish Nyu off, but the hit reverts Nyu back to Lucy, who kills Bando's partner, and goes after Bando. Lucy uses a firearm to shoot and injure Bando. In the end, Bando has been dismembered and blinded. Lucy reverts to Nyu before she is able to kill Bando. It is seen here that Lucy and Nyu switch between each other depending on the events surrounding them. After being injured by Bando, Kohta is put in the hospital, but is not severely injured, and is released hours later while Yuka goes looking for Lucy. He encounters her back at the house and forgives her.
