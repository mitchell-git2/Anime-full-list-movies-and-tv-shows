Entrance exams are being held at the Demon King Academy where they train his descendants to be his successor and become Demon Lords. The entrance exam is a practical test where students must duel each other. Bored of the war-torn world of 2000 years ago, the tyrannical Demon King, Anos, appears on the scene.

His classmates mock him for being a hybrid, and the only teammate he can find is Misha. Their rival team is led by Sasha, Misha&rsquo;s older sister, who looks down on Misha and calls her a &quot;junk doll.&quot;

The Seven Elder Demon Emperors are seven demons that Anos, the founding ancestor, created from his own blood. Emilia implores Anos to act respectfully to Ivis, but without hesitation, he speaks to Ivis in a condescending tone.

She had resigned to her fate that she will only live for 15 years, but Anos tells her, &quot;There are two things that I do not understand. Regret and saying that something is impossible.&quot; The misfit crushes the tragedy and unjust fate that binds the two sisters.

However, Anos refuses and proposes to Ray that, &quot;If you prove that you are worthy, I will allow you to become one of my followers.&quot; Ray decides to form his own team and battles head-to-head with Team Anos during the team competition exam.

The students from the Demon King Academy are visibly offended by this treatment, but Anos&rsquo; words turn the tables. &quot;As usual, humans sure like to set traps for us, don&rsquo;t they?&quot; The inter-academy exchange is off to an ominous start.

Anos says that he will think of a strategy if it becomes necessary, and clashes head-on with his enemies using his vast Magic Powers. However, due to a magic barrier called De Igelia that is cast over the entire city, and a young girl named Zeshia who wields the holy sword Enhale, Anos&rsquo; attacks prove to be futile. Anos and his team are unable to come up with their next strategy, but Misha proposes a plan that could help them win.
