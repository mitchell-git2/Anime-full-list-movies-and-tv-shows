One of the students in the class, Kyotaro Sugishita, becomes furious with what Sakura said and throws a punch at him. The two begin a spectacular fight, ignoring an aloof Hayato Suo, who's carefully watching the fight, and Nirei, who's now panicking.

A tremendously loud voice echoes throughout the school, interrupting the fight between the two young men. The owner of that voice that instantly changed the mood of the entire school is none other than Umemiya, the Representative of Bofurin. Sakura and the rest look nervously up at the speakers to hear Umemiya say something completely unexpected.
