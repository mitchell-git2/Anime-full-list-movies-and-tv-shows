But when he tries to enjoy the break, he can&rsquo;t even figure out what to do and just ends up bored. He heads into town with Gobta to eat some food from the street stalls as they walk around, but in the end, he only feels more motivated to work the fields.

Shuna and Shion have their own unique way to keep cool, and Rimuru tries to think up some fun summer activities&hellip; but bug-catching turns into bug-hunting when the bug he&rsquo;s after turns out to be enormous, and a game of shooting water pistols gets out of hand when Rimuru himself becomes a water cannon. With everything on a completely different scale in Jura, every activity he tries turns into pure chaos! And Rimuru has no idea that he himself is the ideal cold pack&hellip;

The monsters have never experienced a summer festival, but when they hear that it's a party, they go all-in to prepare. All the monsters of Tempest work together and eventually come up with masks, paper lanterns, and even festival floats. On the day of the festival, everyone in the town enjoys piping hot takoyaki, cold shaved ice, yukata, and a Bon dance. In the end, they fill the skies with fireworks as the festival reaches its climax...

With no knowledge of this, Milim explores Tempest and interacts more with the residents of the city of monsters... and Rigurd keeps track of all the damage she causes along the way in a report for Rimuru. &quot;Rigurd... are you angry?&quot;

So Rimuru starts up a good old-fashioned fire awareness campaign. Benimaru is selected as the mascot, but he seems troubled by the assignment... And in the midst of all these, the human Youm and his friends arrive in Tempest.

          <div class="plot">Winter has arrived in Tempest, and so much snow has fallen that its residents can't open their doors until it's shoveled away. But there are at least three like minds there who are finding it hard to resist their childlike urges to dive into the fresh snow: Rimuru, Milim, and Shion. Thus the work begins all around town to shovel Tempest out of the deep snow. Youm objects to being asked to help since he isn't even a citizen, but when he's given the choice between shoveling snow and training with Hakuro, he eagerly grabs the shovel and gets to work.

But... the Christmas tradition doesn't even exist in this world. When Rimuru tries to explain it in detail to the people of Tempest, they end up summarizing it as a &quot;party.&quot; The Christmas cake and presents are ready, and most importantly, Kaijin and the other Dwarves create gorgeous decorations that bring the Christmas mood to Tempest. On top of that, Eren and the children treat everyone in town with their heavenly singing.

Rimuru thought it must be Veldora, the guardian of the Forest of Jura, but everyone else says it's a shrine to Great Rimuru, so he ends up enshrined there... Thus their fun New Year's comes to an end, and Rimuru closes his diary. What will this new year bring? Tomorrow is sure to be packed with enough events to fill a new page...
