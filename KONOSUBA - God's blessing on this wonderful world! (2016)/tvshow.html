          <div class="plot">The party ends up running into Megumin's self-proclaimed rival, Yunyun, during a trip to Wiz's shop. Annoyed at the increased noise level brought on by additional company, Kazuma notices a choker at his feet. After trying it on casually, he runs into big trouble: it's a magical choker designed to make wishes come true, and until his wish does come true, it's going to keep tightening around his neck until he's strangled to death! The others work hard to help make his &quot;dreams&quot; come true so that the choker will come loose, with Wiz offering her thighs as pillows, Darkness doing push ups to make her chest sway, and Megumin and Yunyun engaged in strip rock paper scissors... while Aqua runs errands. But will even that be enough to make the choker come off?

          <div class="plot">After returning from his trip to Arcanretia, Kazuma is living life without a care in the world, thanks to his debts being all paid off by the reward money he earned from eliminating one of the Devil King's generals, Hans. One day, a rookie adventurer named Ran comes up to him in the Guild Hall asking for a handshake. She's apparently become a fan of Kazuma after his consecutive defeat of the Devil King's generals! This puts him in an amazing mood, but it's not long before the Guild receptionist Luna appears, asking him to take on a quest to eliminate a golem. Wanting to look good in front of a fan, Kazuma ends up accepting, and heads towards ancient ruins with Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness in tow.
